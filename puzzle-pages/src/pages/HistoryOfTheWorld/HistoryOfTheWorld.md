# Combat

Standard combat is resolved as follows:  the Attacker roll 2 dice and keep the higher number.  The defender rolls 1 die.  The higher number wins and the defeated army is removed from the board.  In the case of a tie, both armies are removed.

	Attacker Bonuses – The attacker occasionally gets bonuses to the die roll and can roll up to 3 dice if Event Cards were played before the turn.

	Defender Bonuses – The defender may get to roll more dice or get bonuses to the die roll depending on where the attack comes from or if the defender is in a fort.  

    Difficult Terrain:  When you attack over/across Difficult Terrain, the defender gets to roll 2 dice on defense, keeping the higher roll.  Difficult Terrain are the following:  forests, mountains, straits, and the Great Wall of China.  If the Difficult Terrain is in the defender’s Land, then the defender gets to roll 2 dice, keeping the higher.  If the Difficult Terrain is on the attacker’s Land, then there is no defender bonus.  NOTE:  Anytime you attack over a strait, the defender gets to roll 2 dice.  A strait is not on either side of the Land.

	Attacking from the Sea – When you land an army directly from a fleet (as opposed to an adjacent Land), the defender rolls 3 dice when defending, keeping the highest.

	Attacking an Army in a Fort – A defender in a fort gets a defensive bonus in addition to any bonus received for Difficult Terrain (or sea attacks).  A defender in a fort adds +1 to the die roll he or she keeps.  Therefore a rolled 5 becomes a 6.  Furthermore, if the defender loses (or ties), the first piece removed is the fort, not the army in the fort.
